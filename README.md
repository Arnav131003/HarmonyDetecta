## Introduction
Harmony Detecta is a breast cancer prediction project that utilizes logistic regression to predict breast cancer risk based on patient data. The project aims to contribute to early cancer detection, leading to improved healthcare outcomes and patient prognosis.

## Features
- **Logistic Regression Model:** The project employs a logistic regression model to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of breast cancer.
- **Streamlit Web Application:** The breast cancer prediction model is deployed using Streamlit, providing an interactive and user-friendly web interface for medical professionals.
- **Real-time Predictions:** Medical professionals can input patient information into the web application to receive real-time breast cancer risk predictions.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Streamlit application with `streamlit run app.py`.
4. Access the web application through the provided URL.
5. Input patient data, and the model will provide the breast cancer risk prediction.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a carefully curated dataset containing patient attributes, medical history, and breast cancer diagnosis data. Due to privacy and legal concerns, the dataset is not publicly available.
